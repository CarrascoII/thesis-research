# L-TLS: Lightweight TLS for the New IoT World

This tool is used to create a list of possible TLS configurations for a device. It also provides various statistics regarding 
the configurations.These configurations mainly refer to the ciphersuite that is chosen during the Handshake protocol. The tool 
is composed of two main modules:

* Data acquisition module [(l-tls)](./l-tls): Configures which metrics are evaluated and generates data
* Data analysis module [(tools)](./tools): Analyses data and generates graphs and tables

## Data Acquisition Module

This module uses the [Mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/) to implement the TLS protocol. The server and client in the acquision 
module also make use of the Mbed TLS library. There is also a measurement library that implements the measurements of the 
metrics.

The measurement library uses a structure similar to Mbed TLS and allows the implementation of new metrics. This is done by 
creation a new metric module (the structure is the same as the other modules) and adding it to the wrapper module
[(measure_wrap.c)](./l-tls/measurement/library).

## Data Analysis Module

The data analysis can be done by focusing on algorithm types or security services provided. Two sets of tools where created to 
make the analysis:

* Security Services:
  * Analyser: Analyses the performance of security services used in the Handshake protocol for a set of ciphersuites
  * Calculator: Calculates the overall performance of all security services used in the Handshake and/or Record protocol
  for a set of ciphersuites
  * Comparator: Compares the performance of algorithms that provide a certain security service
  * Profiler: Automates the process of acquiring and analysing data. It uses the data acquision module to generate data and
  runs all other tools to generate statistics

* Algorithms:
  * Comparator: Compares the performance of algorithms within the same type (cipher, message digest or key exchange)
  * Plotter: Analyses the provided dataset of all algorithms within the same type
  * Profiler: Automates the process of acquiring and analysing data. It uses the data acquision module to generate data and
  runs all other tools to generate statistics

A graphical user interface (GUI) was created to make it easier to use the tool. Alternatively, each tool can be used from a
command terminal.

# Important Notes

* The Mbed TLS library and the communication peers share a configuration file that is used to select which Mbed TLS modules and 
measurement features are going to be used
* The modules can be used separatly, i.e. the data can be acquiride in the target device and analysed in another machine or they 
can be used simultaneously.
* The modules are not synched, i.e. the data analysis module does not configure the data acquision module. As such, the user 
needs to make sure the data that is going to be analysed is being generated by the acquision module

# Running and Requirements

## Data Acquisition Module

To run this module the following requirements are needs:

* The target device needs to:
  * Establish TCP sockets so that the server/client can communicate
  * Create CSV files in order to save the generated data
  * With the default configuration, this module occupies around 2.4 MiB. This value includes the Mbed TLS library (around 1.2 
  MiB) and the server/client (around 1.2 MiB)
  * To use the `PAPI` library the system needs to have the required counters available. Follow these
  [instructions](https://bitbucket.org/icl/papi/wiki/Downloading-and-Installing-PAPI.md) to configure PAPI.
* `C compiler` installed, such as `gcc`

## Data Analysis Module

* `Python 3.6` installed (it needs to be `3.6` due to the use of the
[formatted string literals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/). If your replace those in the code you can use older 
`Python 3` versions)

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can start using the tools.

# Usage

## Data Acquision Module

This module can be used seperatly. All instructions are relative to the [l-tls](./l-tls) directory.

To use this module, you must first compile the C code by running:

```
make tls_als

```

The `Makefile` also contains other compilation commands. After the compilation is done, run the client and the server. They need 
to be used in two seperate command prompts. To execute them, run the following commands in each comand prompt:

```
./tls_algs/server.out ciphersuite=<ciphersuite_name> [sec_lvl=<initial_lvl>] [max_sec_lvl=<final_lvl>] [msg_size=<initial_size>] 
[max_msg_size=<final_size>] [n_tests=<n_tests>] [path=<data_directory>] [debug_lvl=<debug_lvl>]

./tls_algs/client.out ciphersuite=<ciphersuite_name> [sec_lvl=<initial_lvl>] [max_sec_lvl=<final_lvl>] [msg_size=<initial_size>] 
[max_msg_size=<final_size>] [n_tests=<n_tests>] [path=<data_directory>] [debug_lvl=<debug_lvl>]


positional arguments:
  ciphersuite=<ciphersuite_name>    Name of the ciphersuite to be used

optional arguments:
  sec_lvl=<initial_lvl>             Minimum security level to be used (From 0 to 4, 0 is not considered secure)
  max_sec_lvl=<final_lvl>           Maximum security level to be used (From 0 to 4, 0 is not considered secure)
  msg_size=<initial_size>           Minimum message size to be used, in bytes (From 32 to 16384 = 16KB)
  max_msg_size=<final_size>         Maximum message size to be used, in bytes (From 32 to 16384 = 16KB)
  n_tests=<n_tests>                 Number of iterations for each security level or message size
  path=<data_directory>             Name of the directory where the data will be stored. Root directory is docs/
  debug_lvl=<debug_lvl>             Mbed TLS level of debug (From 0 to 5, where 0 is none and 5 is the maximum)

```

The endpoints will generate data acording to the enabled MEASURE_XXXXX macros. The endpoints will execute the Handshake protocol
in a loop and then the Record protocol in another loop.
